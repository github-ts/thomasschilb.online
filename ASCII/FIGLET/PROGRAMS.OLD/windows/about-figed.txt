Hi all.

I wrote back, but it bounced back because mail comes through a forwarding address to me.  Here's what I wrote....

-----------
I guess it's time for me to come out of hiding.

FIGfont Editor for Windows was never finished, and at some point its source
code became corrupted, and backups were insufficient to prevent its loss.
There is the teeniest tinyest chance that it still exists somewhere, but I
don't have it.  I gave a "tell me what you think" copy to John Cowan and
about 4 other people whose names I don't recall years ago.  I still have
about 80% of its source code, and I may be able to piece it together again
if I ever get around to it.  So if anyone has it, release it to the world!

By the way, FIGFont Editor makes (or made) a pretty cool ASCII Art Editor
too.  You draw letters with the mouse... Depending on the direction of the
lines drawn, the character used to draw lines will be  /, \. |, or - or _,
which it selects automatically.  You can also paint with other characters,
or fill areas like a paint program, cut and copy rectangular areas with or
without transparency (space character= transparent.)

Also, FYI, I have modified FIGWin a little for the modern world... (Meaning
the post-Windows 3.1 era.  It uses long filenames but it is still a 16-bit
program because I am stubborn) but this too is a project I am not likely to
finish soon.  Yes, I do still have its source code.

Kosher?  Yes it's kosher!  :-) I would like to see it running again myself in fact! :-)

I apologize for lack of input over the last two years or so, but I am still on the list, and I still read every mail.  I have continually had paying jobs for my evening time since then, and they must take priority.  Occasionally all projects are finished, and I have worked on FIGWin a bit, but the next version may not be ready for some time.  At one point I offered the source of FIGWin for someone else to finish, but I had no takers.

By the way, I did send source code for both the editor and FIGWin to John Cowan at one point.  John, if you have that source I would be very happy.

     - Paul
